# GAME MATCHMAKING DATABASE PROJECT (MySQL)
## Project Brief

Game Matchmaking Database project focuses on the design and implementation of a relational database system for an online multiplayer game matchmaking platform.

The Game Matchmaking Database is designed using MySQL and models the core game related entities such as players,matches,rankings,loadouts,weapons and player performance statistics.The main goal is to demonstrate correct relational database design,proper normalisation, integrity constraints and database level logic in a structured gaming environment.

# Database Scope (MySQL – Relational)

The MySQL database stores structured operational game data including:

- Players and player profiles

- Player MMR and ranking system

- Matches and match metadata

- Match player performance statistics

- Weapons and loadout configurations

- Many to many relationships using junction tables

- The schema enforces referential integrity using foreign key constraints and cascading rules where appropriate.

---

# Project Goals

The main objectives of this database project are to demonstrate:

- Relational database design and normalization

- Creation of tables with primary and foreign key constraints

- CRUD operations using SQL

- Many to many relationships via junction tables

- Aggregation queries and joins

- Use of stored procedures and database-level logic

- Data integrity and consistency enforcement

# What Is in This Repository?

This repository contains all database related deliverables for the Game Matchmaking System including:

- MySQL database schema definitions

- SQL scripts for table creation and relationships

- Stored procedures and supporting SQL logic

- Sample data for testing and validation
